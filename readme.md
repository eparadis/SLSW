SLSW - Single Letter Substitution Wordgame
a micro-game by Ed Paradis
written for Unity 4.x

In this game, you are given two words.  You must come up with a sequence of words that spans these two words,
but each word can only differ from the previous word by a single letter.  All words must exist in the word list.

Example: "cow to cat"
cow
con
can
cat

The score for this entry would be 3.  It took three steps to reach the final word.
